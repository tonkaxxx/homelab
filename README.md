# Kubernetes Homelab on Alpine Linux ☸

Hey there! 👋 This is my homelab Kubernetes cluster running on **Alpine Linux**

### What's Inside?
- **1 Master Node**
- **2 Worker Nodes**

### Why not Ubuntu?  
- super simple and fast!
- limited resources on my nodes
- always wanted to try something new!  

### What’s Running?  
- cluster deployed with **kubeadm** (someone can say kubeadm is overkill, but i say its practice😉) 
- **longhorn** to achieve persistance
- **telegram bot** to track my lenses schedule
- **prometheus and grafana** metrics and alert system
- minecraft, terraria and valheim server for me and my friends
- **pi-hole** for network-wide ad blocking
- **homarr** for dashboard
- **dashy** - Yet Another Dashboard
- i use **dash** to send system info and resourses to my dashboards
- **seafile** for cloud storage
- **navidrome** for music without ads (free download via soundcloud)
- **openbao** - hashicorp vault analog with mpl license, i need it to write down my passwords and secrets for apps
- **tailscale** for accessing my servers and services outside my network

### Feel free to poke around, steal ideas, or judge my YAML files. 😄
