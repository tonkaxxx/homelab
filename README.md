# Kubernetes Homelab on Alpine Linux â˜¸

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my homelab Kubernetes cluster running on **Alpine Linux**

### What's Inside?
- **1 Master Node**
- **2 Worker Nodes**

### Why not Ubuntu?  
- super simple and fast!
- limited resources on my nodes
- always wanted to try something new!  

### Whatâ€™s Running?  
- cluster deployed with kubeadm (someone can say kubeadm is overkill, but i say its practiceðŸ˜‰) 
- telegram bot to track my lenses schedule
- prometheus metrics and alert system

### Feel free to poke around, steal ideas, or judge my YAML files. ðŸ˜„
