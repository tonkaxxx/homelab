# Kubernetes Homelab on Alpine Linux ☸

Hey there! 👋 This is my homelab Kubernetes cluster running on **Alpine Linux**

### What's Inside?
- **1 Master Node**
- **2 Worker Nodes**

### Why not Ubuntu?  
- super simple and fast!
- limited resources on my nodes
- always wanted to try something new!  

### What’s Running?  
- cluster deployed with kubeadm (someone can say kubeadm is overkill, but i say its practice😉) 
- telegram bot to track my lenses schedule
- prometheus metrics and alert system
- minecraft, terraria and valheim server for me and my friends
- pi-hole for network-wide ad blocking
- homarr for dashboard
- dashy - Yet Another Dashboard
- i use **dash** to send system info and resourses to my dashboards

### Feel free to poke around, steal ideas, or judge my YAML files. 😄
